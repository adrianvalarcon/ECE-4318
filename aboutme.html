			<div><h1>About me:</h1>
				
				<p>Some quick tidbits about myself: I enjoy drawing, spending time with freinds, play video games, and learning new things. I know a fair deal about HTML and less so about CSS, but I hope to keep on learning more about it.<br>Recently Web Development has been an interest of mine. I original used to just code on GitHub, but recently I started making use of Adobe Dreamweaver. In fact! This website was made using Dreamweaver!</p>
				
				<h1>About this page:</h1>
				
				<p>This page is a lot more simple. It is using some quick HTML and CSS to construct a simple looking web page without the help of the HTML5UP template.<br>Here's a quick example of image manipulation using CSS. Below you can see a picture of my puppy Cherie. We got her around February and has been a great addition to the family. The image is normally a vertical portrait.</p>

				<img src="assets/images/cherie.jpg" alt="">

			<div>
				<p>But with the help of of CSS we can make it crop it into a sqaure!</p>
